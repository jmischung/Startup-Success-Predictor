# Startup Success Predictor

This analysis test different neural network configurations to optimize a classifier attempting to predict if a startup applying for funding will be successful. The number of nodes, hidden layers, and dropouts are adjusted to determine the impact on performance.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - For developing and training deep learning ML models
* [Keras](https://keras.io/) - For interacting with TensorFlow through a human-friendly API
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - For analyzing and transforming data
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - For visualizing data

## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

```python
 pip install pandas
 pip install matplotlib
 pip install tensorflow
 pip install jupyterlab
```
